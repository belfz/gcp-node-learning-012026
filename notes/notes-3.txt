Quiz answers:
1. I don't know, you didn't explain it. But I guess it's because "default" config comes with some assumptions which we don't want in production.
2. Because we're not losing anything in case these nodes go down (assuming these are stateless).
3. I guess GCP created those by default.

First, give me the feedback on my answers.

Second, give me a summary of what've done so far. Tell me like if you were my colleague (software engineer).
I need this to be a "story" with brief explanations of each major step. Analogies are welcome.

And remember: DON'T start the next lesson yet!
